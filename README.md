# Mobile-Architect-Programming

Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
    
    This application allows the users to create a user account using a username and password which is added to a database. Once login the user is asked for permission to send SMS messages when items in the inventory are low. The next screen allows the user to add, delete, update, and read all items in inventory.  
    
    What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
    
    In this application there are three screens the login, permission, and inventory screen. The login screen has an ImageView holding the logo image, two EditText one for the username and password, and two buttons one to create an account and the other to allow the user to login. The second screen asks the user for permission to send SMS messages when items are low in inventory. The screen holds one TextView asking for permission and two buttons agree or disagree. The final screen holds inventory with one GridView for the table, four EditTexts for the user to enter in information, and three buttons for add, delete, update.  
    
    How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

To ensure that the program is functional I tested each part of the program. For example, if the user does not enter username or password the program will tell the user to enter in username and password. Testing is very important during the development process allowing the developer to check for problems in the code and fix them before they get to the client. 
    
    Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

During the testing phase I found many problems with my code and had to go back and fix them causing many challenges during the development process. One challenge was getting the table to update with the new items but after testing I found small errors in my code. 
    
    In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
The specific component I did the best on was the login screen it checks that both username and password are not empty and checks they are in the database.
